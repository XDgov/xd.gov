- question: What should I include in my application email?
  answer: Don't worry too much about the content of the email. We're only looking at what's in your attached resumé. Please use the subject line "Emerging Technology Fellowship Application" in your email and email your application to etf@census.gov.

- question: How should I format my resumé?
  answer: Give us an honest read on what makes you a great candidate! Don't undersell yourself and try to use descriptive language about each of your listed roles (i.e. What did you do? What skills/programming languages did you use there? Did you manage a team? etc.). And, be sure to demonstrate **leadership in technology projects**, especially projects that have leveraged any of the topics listed in the "How will my resumé be evaluated?" question below in the FAQs. While we do not require a specific format, your resumé will be reviewed by federal HR specialists. So if you'd like to get a sense of how typical federal resumés are formatted, we encourage you to visit [USAJobs](https://www.usajobs.gov/help/faq/application/documents/resume/what-to-include/) to take a look.

- question: What does an ideal candidate look like?
  answer: We know you're more than a resumé so here are some other things we're looking for. You have an entrepreneurial mindset, are open to trying new things, being wrong, and consistently improving. You are independent yet collaborative, you enjoy working with a variety of technical and non-technical stakeholders, you're passionate about using your skills to solve real-world problems, and you excel at implementing new techniques from ML/AI/Data Science research into your work. You're flexible, you like a challenge, and you're motivated to find creative solutions while guiding/inspiring others along the way. Don't worry if you don't have as much technical expertise; we are looking for project managers and policy experts too!
