      "Blurb": "This project is in phase one of the 10x program. The team includes several xD team members as well as collaborators from other parts of the Census Bureau and other agencies. \n\nThe original project prompt identified a need for a data sharing tool for government agencies and tribal nations to improve transparency and access to transportation data. Our team set out to understand the specific data problems tribal nations face to determine the requirements for such a data tool. Through our interviews with tribal leaders and government employees that work with tribal nations, and our investigation of existing programs involving tribal data, our team learned about many different data challenges that are not limited to data sharing or transportation data. As we explored these data challenges further and considered additional perspectives an overarching theme of distrust between tribal governments and federal government agencies emerged.Â Â \nÂ \nWe recommend that the project move forward and that the next phase is structured as a collaboration with a small group of tribal nations to promote trust building. We propose that the project focuses on identifying one data challenge that, if addressed, would provide significant value to tribal nations. However, we believe there are several conditions that must be met for this work to be successful:Â Â \n- The project team should first **approach this challenge as an opportunity to collaborate** with tribal nations and to learn about their data needs and current data collection practices.Â Â \n- 10x should consider **extending the time frame for phase 2 (perhaps combining timeframes for phase 2 and 3) to allow enough time for relationship building.**Â \n- Rather than attempting to work with multiple tribes to create a data tool or conduct a data collection survey, **the project should be approached as a case study** that focuses on the data needs of 1-3 tribes.Â Â \n\nRead our report and presentation for more details about our proposed project. \n",

      "Blurb": "xD recently closed its application period for the 2024 emerging technology fellowship â€“ thank you to all who applied! Over the past six months, xD fellows have worked on a range of technology projects with different partners across the federal government. As we prepare to welcome new team members, we asked our 2023 fellows to share a few thoughts about their experiences so far on the xD team â€“ what theyâ€™ve learned, their favorite thing about the xD team, and what they aim to accomplish in 2024.Â  Here are their reflections on the past few months:Â Â \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Â \nDiamondÂ \n**Current Projects: **Iâ€™m working on the Database Modernization project that is focused on moving on-premises servers into the cloud. This is a multi-year project that will assist the Census Bureau with open-source technology adoption.Â \n\n**Learnings from 2023: **The biggest learning I had from my project so far is being open to change. Over time, the focus of my project has shifted to higher priority data migrations. So being flexible and continuously seeking the root problem that we are solving has been key.Â \n\n**Favorite thing about xD: **My favorite thing about xD is everyone in this cohort. Every person brings such a unique skillset to our group. This makes it super easy to learn new tools and technologies from each other. Moreover, each person's understanding of when to lead and when to follow makes this such a collaborative environment. I canâ€™t think of better people to share this experience with.Â Â \n\n**Goals for 2024:**Â \n\n- Grow in my practical understanding in artificial intelligence and machine learning and product management.Â \n- Complete IRE-EDL data migration MVP by September 2024Â \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Â \nTomoÂ \nÂ \nÂ \n\n**Current Projects:**Â My work right now focuses on how to use privacy enhancing technologies to connect sensitive datasets that have different owners in a secure way. The long-term goal of that work is to enable third-party audits of machine learning models so that engineers and practitioners who build these models can detect disparities or biases in their work both reliably and quickly.Â \n\n**Learnings from 2023: **One of the biggest things I learned in my first six months at xD is that even though starting out a new project can be a bit overwhelming at first, the key is to ask for help when you need it and not get too stuck in the mud trying to figure things out yourself. Itâ€™s another reason that I so appreciate the awesome team that we have!Â \n\n**Favorite thing about xD: **One of my favorite things about xD is the stellar team of people weâ€™ve put together. Everyone on the team is both extremely friendly and extremely good at what they do.Â \n\n**Goals for 2024:**Â \n\n- Create a demo to show how we can use PETs to enable third party audits of ML systemsÂ \n- Work towards using PETs to join datasets across different federal agenciesÂ \n- Publish my work in blog posts and papersÂ \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Â \nMikeÂ Â \nÂ \nÂ \n\n**Current Projects:Â **Iâ€™m working on user-centered model cards for transparent documentation of government applications of machine learning and a privacy enhancing technologies lab to help policymakers and developers implement best practices for sharing sensitive information while protecting privacy.Â \n\n**Learnings from 2023:**Â Thinking about technical challenges with social impact can be daunting. Developing creative solutions together has helped build nuance into our teamâ€™s approach. Iâ€™ve learned so much through interrogating gaps in my own understanding and workshopping ideas with other fellows.Â \n\n**Favorite thing about xD: **The most exciting thing about xD is the opportunity for collaboration within our awesome cohort of fellows, across government, nonprofits, academic labs, and industry.Â \n\n**Goals for 2024:**Â \n\n- Publish work on model cards and ML audits using privacy enhancing technologies.Â \n- Onboard the next emerging technology fellowship cohort!Â \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Â \nAnnaÂ \n**Current Projects:** I am currently working on a pilot project to establish a secure multi-party computation between Census and the Bureau of Economic Analysis.Â Â \n\n**Learnings from 2023:Â **Â \n**Favorite thing about xD:**Â \n\n**Goals for 2024:**Â \n\n- Build MVP for the Census-Bureau of Economic Analysis SMPC projectÂ \n- Facilitate an external speaker presentation about data visualization researchÂ \n- Present at one of Censusâ€™ affinity groupsÂ \nÂ Â \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Â \nCurtisÂ \nÂ \n**Current Projects:Â **Iâ€™m working on privacy enhancing technologies (or PETs) both with a group at the United Nations andÂ with NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We are working on deploying, testing, and documenting PETs for different use cases. Another area Iâ€™m contributing to is bias mitigation in AI applications. Specifically, Iâ€™m creating tools and proofs-of-concept for Census Bureau teams such as a [model card generator](https://bias.xd.gov/resources/model-card-generator/tool/). Iâ€™ve also been helping to maintain and update our team website. Â \n\n**Learnings from 2023: **Keeping stakeholders engaged is key to moving a project forward and along the correct path. Also, working in government often requires the review or approval ofÂ severalÂ different parties, so itâ€™s important to have different projects you can pivot to during times when youâ€™re waiting on work from others.Â \n\n**Favorite thing about xD: **The best part of being on the xD team is being able to work with a great group of people with diverse skillsets and backgrounds on lots of interesting applications in government.Â \n\n**Goals for 2024:**Â \n\n- Publish a paper and give a conference presentation about our ongoing privacy enhancing technology projects.Â \n- Add new sections and features to xd.gov to increase our web presence and better publicize our work.Â \n- Hire and onboard new fellows!Â \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_Â \n\nIanÂ \n**Current Projects:**Â Â \n**Learnings from 2023:Â **Â \n\n**Favorite thing about xD:**Â \n\n**Goals for 2024:**Â \n",
