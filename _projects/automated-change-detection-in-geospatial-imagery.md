title: Automated Change Detection in Geospatial Imagery
subtitle: Employing machine learning on satellite imagery to improve representation in surveys.
excerpt: This project seeks to reduce the need for field work including boots on the ground and eyes-on manual change detection, eliminating sources of bias in the current workflow and improving representation in surveys.

<p>
  Are there emerging technologies and methods that might serve us as we work to ensure we have timely
  and complete collection of residential addresses from which we create critical data? Weâ€™re employing
  machine learning models which correlate changes in housing unit data with satellite imagery to improve
  automation around change detection and bias reduction. If successful, this project will reduce the need
  for field work including boots on the ground and eyes-on manual change detection, eliminating sources
  of bias in the current workflow and improving representation in surveys.
