What if you could answer questions using data that you never actually see? This project seeks to increase our understanding of privacy-enhancing technologies (PET), including remote execution/federated learning, secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, and differential privacy. If successful, this project will create a roadmap for future deployments of these technologies to transform how the Census Bureau collects, shares, and computes on data from its customers, other federal agencies, and other governments.
