<p>
  Disinformation and misinformation threaten the government's ability to ensure essential civic programs, such as the U.S. Census, reach everyone in the United States. In this project, weâ€™re leverage machine learning, natural lanaguge processing, and other methods in collaboration with academic partners to track the spread of, and mitigate, factually incorrect information about the U.S. Census sourced by malign actors.
