<p>
In a set of initial pilots, weâ€™re prototyping a series of privacy-enhancing data exchanges that enable secure, multi-party computation to be performed. 
<br>
<br>

If successful, this work outlines several paths forward for how to produce more timely and granular data while maintaining privacy and trust. Thus creating viable paths for augmenting and in some cases replacing traditional data sharing where appropriate
