<h3>Premise</h3>
<p>
  Across all federal agencies, statisticians, developers, designers, and data
  scientists are tackling the same problem: how to present the government‘s vast
  amount of data to the public. This approach has led to the creation of
  competing standards within agencies and across government – leading to
  inconsistent user experiences and slowing down the release of valuable data.
</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>
  The Data Visualization Standards are a collection of tools and templates to make 
  government data more accessible, consistent, and easy to use for everyone.
  The Standards include visualization principles and breakdowns of different
  types of visualizations written by experts at the U.S. Census Bureau.
</p>
<p>
  The Standards are optional but available for everyone to use.
  They‘re also open source and continue to develop as more agencies and
  practioners get involved in the project.
