  Creating a Client-Side Model Card Generator
</p>

<p>
  Recently at xD we've been working on features related to model cards.
</p>

```javascript
function sayHello(name) {
  if (!name) {
    console.log('Hello World');
  } else {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
  }
}
```

<h2>HTML Form Validation</h2>

<p>The general workflow...</p>
