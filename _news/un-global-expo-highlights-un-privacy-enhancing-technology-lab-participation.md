  Team xD is thrilled to announce the U.S. Census Bureau’s involvement in the 
  United Nations’ Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PET) Lab pilot alongside 
  Statistics Netherlands, ISTAT of Italy, and the U.K.’s Office for National 
  Statistics.

<p>
  As the U.S. representative for the pilot, the Census Bureau wanted to ensure 
  it included a diverse set of subject-matter experts which include Team xD, 
  the Office of Information Security (OIS) and other offices within the Office 
  of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). “This collaborative initiative 
  introduces a new era in statistical research and data science by accelerating 
  the use of data while maintaining the security, privacy and confidentiality,” 
  said Chief Information Security Officer Beau Houser.

  This week at the U.N. Expo, we are demoing how researchers from participating 
  countries can compute on trade data they cannot see using an open-source 
  platform called PySyft, a peer-to-peer remote data science platform that 
  leverages Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, and Encrypted Computation 
  (like Secure Multi-Party Computation [SMPC] and Homomorphic Encryption [HE]) 
  to enable data owners to keep their data private while simultaneously 
  supporting computation on it. For the Census Bureau, this project represents 
  an opportunity to explore what the 
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/deploying-privacy-enhancing-technologies/">future of PETs</a>
  and differential privacy means to delivering more valuable data to our 
  customers, stakeholders and collaborators across the world without
  compromising our commitments to data privacy and security.

  As Census Bureau Deputy Director and Chief Operating Officer Ron Jarmin 
  highlighted at the U.N. Expo, “Economic measurement continues to provide 
  critical statistics on the health and performance of economies, but current 
  methods for collecting and disseminating statistical information are not 
  sustainable. We realize the importance of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies as 
  critical to how we deliver on our mission. We're investing today in practical 
  ways to test these emerging technologies because we believe they provide a 
  vision for how we might continue to serve the public with timely, reliable 
  data that preserves privacy and trust.”
