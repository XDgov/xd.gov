    <p>
      xD works in multi-disciplinary teams of engineers, project managers, and
      data scientists to support the research and application of artificial
      intelligence solutions to the delivery of government services. Each team
      works with federal stakeholders across government and often with the
      support of outside partners, such as academic research groups, to apply
      the latest innovations in artificial intelligence to each project.
