blurb: <p>Ally Burleson-Gibson (she/her) manages the Emerging Technology Fellowship with xD and builds partnerships to bring highly skilled technologists into government. Just before xD, Ally led a team of project managers on the Operational Readiness and Integration team for the 2020 Census, and before that worked with the public to teach them how to find and use Census Bureau data through a variety of tools on census.gov, and then later engaged stakeholders and captured their feedback to help inform the development of data.census.gov. Ally also worked in state government and non-profits, typically in community social work settings with newly arrived immigrants and refugees and facilitating their access to services, with emphasis on health care for children with special needs. When not trying to re-imagine the best path to finding amazing candidates to work with us, Ally loves walking her dog and having fun with her two adolescent kids, who are always on the go!</p>
