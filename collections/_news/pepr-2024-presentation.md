    We are excited to share “A New Model for International, Privacy-Preserving Data Science,” a talk given by xD’s <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/team/curtis-mitchell">Curtis Mitchell</a> at the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr24" target="_blank">2024 Privacy Engineering Practice and Respect</a> (PEPR) conference in June. In the talk Curtis describes xD’s role in a project with the United Nations PET Lab to demonstrate the feasibility of an international data join between national statistical organizations, such as the Census Bureau, that maintains the privacy of the subjects in the data. He also reviews the details of the PySyft platform used in the project and shares some of the future goals for this work.
