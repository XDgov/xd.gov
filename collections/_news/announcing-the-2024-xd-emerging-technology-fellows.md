<p>
  Join us in welcoming the five newest members of the xD team's Emerging Technology Fellowship (ETF)!
</p>

<p>
  These visionary technologists and innovators bring highly sought-after expertise to the Census Bureau in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, data science, data engineering, and project management with specializations in data architecture, algorithmic transparency, algorithmic bias mitigation, privacy enhancing technologies and human-computer interaction.
</p>

<p>
  “We're very excited to welcome this new group of colleagues that will bring additional expertise and new ideas to improve how the Census Bureau works with other government partners and the public!" - Curtis Mitchell, 2023 ETF
</p>

<p>
  The Emerging Tech Fellowship is a key component of xD’s mission to advance the delivery of data-driven services through new and transformative technologies. The 2024 cohort will join our existing 2023 fellows to work on mission-critical technology challenges at the Census Bureau with the Decennial Information Technology Division, Enhancing Health Data Programs, Economics Directorate, Research & Methodology Directorate, and the Deputy Director’s Office as well as other partner agencies such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the General Services Administration.
</p>

<p>
  “Each cohort of Emerging Technology Fellows is an opportunity to bring new and diverse perspectives and talents to the Bureau's mission and government more broadly. I couldn't be more excited to welcome this group and see all that they'll do for the public good.” - Kate McCall-Kiley, xD Lead

  <p><span class="title">Jess Stahl (she/her)</span> serves as Vice President, Data Science & Analytics for the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, directing data and AI policy & governance. She is the AI in Higher Education Advisory Board Chair and leads national initiatives on AI governance and data privacy, often collaborating with non-profit, industry, philanthropic, and academic organizations. She leads the IAAA certification working group to develop global industry standards for AI (algorithmic) auditing. She is a Doctor of Behavioral Health and holds a M.Sc. in Health Economics, Policy, and Management from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). Previously, she served as Assistant Dean for Strategic Initiatives and Quality Advancement at the University of Arizona, Health Sciences and was a faculty member (College of Nursing) and guest lecturer (College of Medicine, College of Pharmacy, College of Management). She also held multiple roles with a non-profit organization building AI governance infrastructure using privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) to facilitate access to AI systems and data for audit/research. She is a member of the UN PET Lab/Task Team, which focus on facilitating research, collaboration, and exploration of PETs implementation by national statistics offices. Through America's DataHub Consortium (NSF/NCSES), she collaborates with leading PETs providers to explore the potential for PETs methodologies to expand access to national statistical data for research. As an Emerging Technology Fellow, she looks forward to contributing to key data/AI and national data/AI infrastructure initiatives (e.g., National Secure Data Service, National AI Research Resource) and efficient governance structures to ensure those systems are well-aligned with federal regulations and best practices.</p>
