    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <div class="mini-border"></div>
    <p>
      We build products that challenge the status quo of how federal agencies leverage
      their public data. To meet the growing demands of business and technology,
      we work closely with our agency partners to deliver new and exceptional
      product experiences to their constituents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In support of this mission, our team recruits top technical talent from the
      fields of design, technology, and data science. We adhere to a user-centered
      design process and use agile delivery methods to deliver prototypes quickly
      and at a reasonable cost.
