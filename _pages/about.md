    <p>
      Across the federal government, there are a tremendous number of organizations
      working diligently to modernize information technology services. This work
      is incredibly important and is creating new and exciting opportunities for
      more robust technology solutions to be applied towards the improvement of
      public services. As the complexity of federal data challenges increases,
      artificial intelligence presents unique opportunities to radically transform
      the quality and type of public services being delivered.
