    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
      xD is an office of federal employees at the U.S. Census Bureau that
      partners with federal agencies, academic institutions, and research centers
      to create better government products and services with the latest
      technologies. We are a team of data scientists, software engineers,
      designers, and product managers working together to deliver cutting-edge
      data products for the public good.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>
      We believe in putting users first, prototyping quickly, and using agile
      delivery methods to create better products and services at less cost. To
      that end, xD is a cost-recoverable team – meaning that we are required to
      charge partner agencies for our work through 
      <a href="https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/fincMgmtStdzn/iaa_forms.htm" target="_blank">
        Interagency Agreements
      </a>
      (IAAs).
    </p>
    <p>
      xD also partners with external organizations and institutions that have
      specialized expertise in data management through Joint Partnership
      Agreements (JPAs). This allows our team to leverage the innovation of the
      private sector towards products and services that benefit the public.
