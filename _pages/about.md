    xD is a startup in the <a href="https://www.census.gov" target="_blank">U.S. Census Bureau</a> that works with internal
    partners and other agencies to build experimental data products.
  </p>
  <h3>Our Mission</h3>
  <div class="mini-border"></div>
  <p>
    We build products that challenge the status quo of how agencies leverage
    their public data. To meet the growing demands of business and technology,
    we work closely with our agency partners to deliver new and exceptional
    product experiences to their constituents.
  </p>
  <p>
    In support of this mission, our team recruits top technical talent from the
    fields of design, technology, and data science. We adhere to a user-centered
    design process and use agile delivery methods to deliver prototypes quickly
    and at a reasonable cost.
