          We’re looking for purpose-driven technologists and innovators to 
          join this unique fellowship experience with xD. The <b>Emerging 
          Technology Fellowship (ETF)</b> recruits the best and brightest
          technologists with expertise in emerging data technology trends to 
          drive data innovation at the U.S. Census Bureau and other federal agencies.

                  We foster the work of great technological minds to bring innovative solutions to 
                  the civic tech space. Collaborating inside and outside of government, we believe 
                  partnership is key to advancing innovations to create efficiency and to further 
                  the reach of the vast troves of data that the Census Bureau has collected and the 
                  research the agency has shared for more than a century. At xD, we also believe 
                  that work should be fun, and we make space to bring our authentic selves to the 
                  ‘office.’

                  growth and exploration at the U.S. Census Bureau and beyond! </b>

                  salary ranging from $81,000 to $147,000 and full Federal benefits. Fellows will 
                  have the opportunity to advance the deployment of privacy-enhancing technologies 
                  or to mitigate bias in AI as part of xD’s existing portfolios of work, while 
                  simultaneously pursuing their own research interests with one of the largest data 
                  dissemination agencies in the world.

                  Fellows are driven by a sense of curiosity and bring their know-how and intellect 
                  to projects while viewing challenges as a blank slate to introduce ground-breaking 
                  technical solutions. Enthusiasm to share their ideas, make a positive impact, and 
                  to guide others in the pursuit of the high-tech modernization of government is a 
                  driver for these leaders. Being unafraid to make waves when necessary while 
                  maintaining a healthy approach to risk mitigation, fellows bring an 
                  entrepreneurial spirit to their work and believe in their ability to bring lasting 
                  change as part of a dedicated team.

                  You have wide-ranging tech experience and are compelled to make government better. 
                  Data science, machine learning, AI, natural language processing, web scraping, 
                  software development, secure multi-party computation, programming languages, and 
                  design are just a few of the things that could make you a great candidate. We’re 
                  also looking for those with experience leading complex IT projects, being deft at 
                  stakeholder engagement, understanding data privacy as well as protecting the 
                  public’s data security. If you have full lifecycle project planning and management 
                  skills, have served as a liaison to the public or to senior leadership, or are an 
                  accomplished researcher or writer, you may be a great fit for the Emerging
