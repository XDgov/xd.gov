        <h3>What to Expect</h3>
        <p>
          We love a good challenge. We expect you to solve problems creatively -
          from pitching new projects to delivering innovative solutions. We work
          to foster a startup mentality and culture and that means small teams,
          quick wins, and a need for self-starters.
