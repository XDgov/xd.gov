  Our very own co-founder Kate McCall-Kiley has been named to the 2019 class of MIT Media Lab Director's Fellows. The Director's Fellows program connects a global community of charismatic and visionary leaders to the antidisciplinary research culture of the MIT Media Lab. Through curated collaborations, the program aims to expand the perspectives of our academic community, while strengthening the fellows’ capacity to serve and lead, addressing pressing issues through the lens of civic engagement, social change, education, and creative disruption.
